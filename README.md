# wine_project
Two datasets were created, using red and white wine samples. The inputs include objective tests (e.g. PH values) and the output is based on sensory data (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). Several data mining methods were applied to model these datasets under a regression approach. The support vector machine model achieved the best results. Several metrics were computed: MAD, confusion matrix for a fixed error tolerance (T), etc. Also, we plot the relative importances of the input variables (as measured by a sensitivity analysis procedure).
